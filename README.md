Project Overview:
The Bharat States Game is an interactive Python-based quiz game designed with the help of Turtle to test your knowledge of the states in India. The game prompts users to input the names of Bharat states, and for each correct answer, the user's score increases. If the user is unable to name a state, they can type "exit," at which point the game will generate a CSV file containing the names of the states they couldn't identify. 

The repositery contains the following files:
- Blank Bharat map
- main file: contains the main source code
- mapping file: contains the co-ordinates stuff code
- states name CSV file: contains the all 28 states name with their respective Co-ordinates(x, y) to use in Turtle graphics
